# RelativityPathTracer
A real-time OpenCL path tracer to visualize the optical effects of Special Relativity

## Usage
`.\RelativityPathTracer.exe`
or
`.\RelativityPathTracer.exe < Scenes/[scene].txt`

When running without a scene file, custom objects may be added using the command line.  
The following syntax can be used on the command line or piped in from a scene file:  
1. `O[s|c|m#]`  
    Create a new object. `s` creates a sphere primitive, 
    `c` creates a cube primitive, 
    and `m#` creates a mesh, where `#` is the index of an imported mesh.  
    The following commands are applied to the most recently created object:  
    * `p#,#,#,#,#,#,#,#,#,#`  
      Set the translation, rotation, and scale of the object relative to the scene origin. Each `#` must be replaced by one floating-point value.
      The order of values is the following: `ptx,ty,tz,a,rx,ry,rz,sx,sy,sz` corresponds to a translation by `(tx, ty, tz)`, 
      a rotation by `a` radians about the axis `(rx, ry, rz)`, 
      and scaling by `sx` along the x-axis, `sy` along the y-axis, and `sz` along the z-axis.
    * `c#,#,#`  
      Set the color of the object. Each `#` must be replaced by one floating-point value.
      The color is stored in RGB Float where a value of `(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f)` is white.
      The brightness of the color will be affected by the scene's white-point (see `W#,#,#`).
      If the object is set to be a light (see `l#`), its color and brightness is determined by this color value.
      If the object is given a texture (see `t#`), this color value will not be used for the object's surface color.
    * `t#`  
      Assign a texture to the object. `#` must be replaced by a non-negative integer value corresponding to the index of the desired texture.
    * `l#`  
      If `#` is 0, the object will not emit light. 
      If `#` is non-zero, the object will become a light source whose brightness and color is determined by the object's color (see `c#,#,#`).
    * `v#,#,#`  
      Set the object's velocity. Each `#` must be replaced by a floating point value where `-1.0 < # < 1.0f`. 
      The order of values is `vx,y,z` for velocity vector `(x,y,z)`, whose length must be strictly less than `1.0`. 
      This velocity is represented in units of `c` (speed of light in a vacuum) and therefore an object's speed must be less than `1c`.
    * `f#,#`  
      Set the object to emit a periodic flash.
      Note: This flash does not emit light as if the object were a light source, instead it increases the brightness of the object's surface.
      The two values `#,#` correspond to two floating point values `frequency` and `duration` respectively.
      The object will increase in brightness once every `frequency` seconds, and will stay lit for `duration` seconds. 
      The object's proper time at each point on its surface is used to determine when to light up. 
      This means a moving object will appear to have a lower frequency (Time dilation), 
      and will also not appear to flash simultaneously across its surface (Relativity of simultaneity).
2. `T[filename]`  
   Import a new texture. Giving an invalid `filename` will cause the program to exit.
   The order in which textures are imported determines their "index", (see `t#`). The first texture imported has index `0`.
3. `M[filename]`  
   Import a new .obj mesh. Giving an invalid `filename`, including one that is not a `.obj` file, will cause the program to exit.
   The order in which meshes are imported determines their "index", (see `m#`). The first mesh imported has index `0`.
4. `A#`  
   Set the scene's ambient light intensity. `#` must be a floating point value.
   The ambient light determines how bright objects are when not lit by direct lighting.
   The appearance of ambiently lit objects is affected by the scene's white-point (see `W#,#,#`).
5. `W#,#,#`  
   Set the scene's white-point. This value determines the minimum intensity for a pixel to be fully lit. 
   Any pixels with greater intensity than the white point will be clamped to `1.0`, 
   and any pixels with less intensity will be scaled using [Hable tonemapping](http://filmicworlds.com/blog/filmic-tonemapping-operators/).
6. `I`  
   When the `I` command is given, propagation of light within the scene is set to be disabled by default. 
   A running scene can toggle this option by pressing the `i` key on the keyboard. With light propagation disabled,
   you see each point on a object as it exists in that instant, without accounting for how long it would take the light to reach your eyes.
   Light sources and shadows are disabled when light propagation is disabled.  Instead, ambient lighting is set to `1.0`.
   This is because there is no consistent way to trace the path of an infinite-speed ray.
7. `R`  
   Finalize scene generation, then run the application.
   If the `R` command is given at any point the scene file/command line will stop parsing further input.

  I used this tutorial as a guide to get the initial OpenCL ray tracing platform working. I have rewritten most of the OpenCL kernel,
  but a significant portion of the OpenCL-OpenGL interop setup code is still from this tutorial. I forked this project from [straaljager/OpenCL-path-tracing-tutorial-3-Part-1](https://github.com/straaljager/OpenCL-path-tracing-tutorial-3-Part-1).
* [Ray Tracing: Rendering a Triangle](https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/ray-tracing-rendering-a-triangle/moller-trumbore-ray-triangle-intersection)  
  I used this article's code in the OpenCL kernel for ray-triangle intersection. It uses an algorithm found in "Fast, Minimum Storage Ray/Triangle Intersection by MÃ¶ller & Trumbore"

  I used this ray-box intersection algorithm in the OpenCL kernel.
